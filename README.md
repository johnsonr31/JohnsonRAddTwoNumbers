HOW TO USE: Open the project in VSCode and click "Run and Debug." After the project starts, and opens a browser tab, go into the debug console and look through the white text until you find the URL with "http" at the beginning instead of "https," and copy and past that into an API platform such as Postman. After you paste it, you will need to add "/AddTwoNumbers/adding/{number1}/{number2}" to the end of the URL, but type the two numbers you want to add together in place of {number1} and {number2}. After you've done that, the text that is returned should say the sum of the two numbers you entered in the URL.
